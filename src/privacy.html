        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 9/08/2025</p>
        <p>
            WhereFam (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy. This Privacy
            Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our app.
        </p>

        <h2>1. No Personal Data Collected or Stored</h2>
        <p>
            We do <strong>not collect, store, or process</strong> any personal
            data on our servers. Our app operates on a
            <strong>peer-to-peer (P2P)</strong> model, meaning all
            communications and location sharing occur
            <strong>directly between users' devices</strong>. We do
            <strong>not have access</strong> to the content you share or your
            location data.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Peer-to-Peer Communication</h2>
        <p>
            All location sharing and communication are handled device-to-device
            using a decentralized P2P network. This means:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Your location data stays on your device and is sent only to
                selected recipients.
            </li>
            <li>
                No data is transmitted to or stored on any centralized server we
                control.
            </li>
            <li>
                We cannot access, intercept, or log your location or messages.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Donations and Payments (via RevenueCat)</h2>
        <p>
            We use <strong>RevenueCat</strong>, a third-party service, to
            process <strong>voluntary donations or tips</strong>. We do not
            collect or store any payment information ourselves. RevenueCat may
            collect data such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Purchase history (e.g., donation amount, time of donation)</li>
            <li>
                Device identifiers (e.g., to manage subscriptions or restore
                purchases)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do,
            we’ll notify you via the app or update the “Effective Date” above.
            Continued use of the app means you agree to the revised policy.
